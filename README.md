# Knapsack_problem
Uni project

This project aims to demonstrate algorithms that solve the 0-1 knapsack problem that asks the question: “Which items should be put in the backpack so that their value is as high as possible and at the same time it's possible to fit them into the backpack?”. To solve this problem I implemented three algorithms: dynamic, greedy and brute force. I also implemented a backpack generator, in which you can customize the backpack's capacity and the number of items.
